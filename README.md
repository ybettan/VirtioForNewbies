# VirtioForNewbies

## Introduction
My name is Yonathan Bettan and I work at RedHat in the virtualization KVM team.

This blog has 2 main purposes, the first is to give you an idea of what virtio is and why should we use it when the second is to serve as a step-by-step guide describing how to write a virtio device from scratch with some code examples.

In addition, I will write a SIMPLE virtio educational example and documented device that you will be able to find in my [fork](https://github.com/ybettan/qemu/tree/virtio/hw/virtio) of the Qemu project at  and its driver [here](https://github.com/ybettan/QemuDeviceDrivers/tree/master/virtio).
